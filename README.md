# TALES: Text Adventure Learning Environment Suite
An anonymized repository for the submission of TALES: Text Adventure Learning Environment Suite for ICLR 2026. The purpose of this repository is to host the anonymized code, time-stamped to verify it was not modified after the main paper submission deadline (Sept 24th-2025 AoE).

Visualizations of all game scores averaged across seeds are available in this repository. We do not modify the visualizations below after the main paper submission deadline due to referencing them in the abstract.

Note that the images are fairly large due to the combination of number of models and number of games. On a slower device, you may experience some lag when opening the images.
