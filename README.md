An anonymized repository for the submission of TALES: Text Adventure Learning Environment Suite for NeurIPS 2025. The purpose of this repository is to host the anonymized code, time-stamped to verify it was not modified after the main paper submission deadline (May 15th-2025 AoE), and other supplementary material, timestamped to verify it was not modified after supplementary material deadline (May 22nd-2025 AoE).

Visualizations of all game scores averaged across seeds are available in this repository.

Note that the images are fairly large due to the combination of number of models and number of games. On a slower device, you may experience some lag when opening the images.
